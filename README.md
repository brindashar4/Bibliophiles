# Bibliophiles

The purpose of the site is to build a community of all types of readers to rate, analyze and provide user-to-user recommended books and if needed, order books they are interested in from e-commerce sites like
Amazon. The application maintains information of book titles like their author, a synopsis, it’s genre and with options for a given user to
purchase the book from an e-commerce site as well as add the books to the user’s personal shelf. The website shows globally approved top books of the
month, so that the users can stay in touch with the trending ones. The website will also be able to display new and upcoming books if a user wishes to be
updated about current literature being published everyday.
