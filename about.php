                <h2>  A Message From Our CEO and Co-Founder</h2>
                <p>
                When I was in second grade, I discovered the Hardy Boys series.
                Ever since, I've loved to read — both for fun and to improve my mind.
                And I'm always looking for the next great book.
                </p>
                <p>
                One afternoon while I was scanning a friend's bookshelf for ideas, it
                struck me: when I want to know what books to read, I'd rather turn to a
                friend than any random person or bestseller list.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                So I decided to build a website Bibliophiles, a place where I could see my
                friends' bookshelves and learn about what they thought of all their books.
                Elizabeth, my co-founder (and now my wife) wrote the site copy and I wrote
                the code. We started in my living room, motivated by the belief that there
                was a better way to discover and discuss good books, and that we could
                build it.
                </p>
                <p>
                Goodreads is that site. It is a place where you can see what your friends
                are reading and vice versa. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what
                you've read (or want to read). You can comment on each other's reviews.
                You can find your next favorite book. And on this journey with your
                friends you can explore new territory, gather information, and expand
                your mind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Knowledge is power, and power is best shared among readers.
